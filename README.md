// Hello, I'm Kheera 👩🏾‍💻

A simulation engineer passionate about immersive systems, machine learning, and smart city development. My work blends creativity and technology across interactive simulations, XR, and real-world applications.

I’m currently expanding my skills in Unreal, Unity, VR/AR, Digital Fabrication, Arduino, and SolidWorks alongside programming in Python, C++, C#, and MATLAB. I'm especially interested in how simulation and AI can shape future-forward environments and connected systems.

Always open to collaborating on projects related to simulation, AI agents, or emerging tech for urban innovation. 

Based in the U.S. and excited to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of interaction, engineering, and impact.
