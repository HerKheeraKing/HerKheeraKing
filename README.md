// Hello, I'm Kheera 👩🏾‍💻

🛰️ A simulation engineer passionate about immersive systems, machine learning, and smart city development. My work blends creativity and technology across interactive simulations, XR, and real-world applications.

🛠️ I’m currently expanding my skills in Unreal, Unity, VR/AR, Digital Fabrication, Arduino, and SolidWorks—alongside programming in Python, C++, C#, and MATLAB. I'm especially interested in how simulation and AI can shape future-forward environments and connected systems.

🤝 Always open to collaborating on projects related to simulation, AI agents, or emerging tech for urban innovation. 

🌐 Based in the U.S. and excited to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of interaction, engineering, and impact.
